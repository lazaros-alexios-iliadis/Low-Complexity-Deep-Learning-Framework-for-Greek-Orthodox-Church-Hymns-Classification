DL methods are applied on the task of Greek Orthodox Church Hymns Classification. The audio files are first transformed
into Mel-spectrograms and then three custom CNNs and five pre-trained CNNs are trained on our private dataset. The models 
are compared in terms of accuracy and computational cost.

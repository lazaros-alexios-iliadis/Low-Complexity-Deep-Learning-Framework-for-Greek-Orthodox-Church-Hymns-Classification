https://doi.org/10.3390/app13158638
DL methods are applied to the task of Greek Orthodox Church Hymns Classification. The audio files are first transformed
into Mel-spectrograms and then three custom CNNs and five pre-trained CNNs are trained on our private dataset. The models 
are compared in terms of accuracy and computational cost.

This research was carried out as part of the project 'Recognition and direct characterization of cultural items for the education and promotion of Byzantine Music using artificial intelligence (Project code: KMP6-0078938) under the framework of the Action Investment 'Plans of Innovation' of the Operational Program Central Macedonia 2014-2020.
